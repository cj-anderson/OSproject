# OSproject
Operating Systems Project 471

Caleb Anderson

### Language Used:

C++

## Objective(s)

The project deals with two problems related to operating systems:
1. CPU Scheduling (50 points)

2. Process Synchronization (50 points)
The background material required to solve these problems has been covered in chapters
3-6 of the textbook. You can choose either Java or C++ as a programming language for
the project. Solutions to each of these problems will be graded separately. You are
required to submit the following by the deadline. You will submit a single directory that
has two subdirectories for each of the problems. 

The directory you submit will have the
following structure:

CS471PROJECT (main dir)

-------------- CPUSCHED (subdir 1)

-------------- README file with directions (make sure to include
actual commands that can be copied and pasted to run)

-------------- SOURCE code (well documented)

-------------- Executable code
-------------- Sample input data files

-------------- Sample output file(s)

--------------- PRODUCER-CONSUMER (subdir 2)

-------------- README file with directions (make sure to include
actual commands that can be copied and pasted to run)

-------------- SOURCE code (well documented)

-------------- Executable code

-------------- Sample input data files

-------------- Sample output file(s)
